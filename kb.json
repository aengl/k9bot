      "question": "I am thinking about organising an event. What should I consider?",
      "answer": "Events with more than 5 guests/participants should be announced. Every event must have an organizer, who is responsible for all visitors, cleaning and for getting approval from the facilitator if the event might disturb others.\n\nRegarding cleaning, it needs to be done the day after by 8am if weekday and by 12 noon if weekend. For house parties that almost all residents participated in, 6pm the day after is OK. Events benefitting all residents will get one hour of cleaning (by the house cleaners) on the house budget. The rest of the amount will be payed by the host (250sek an hour per cleaner)."
